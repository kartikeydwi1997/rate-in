App Name- RateIn

App description - Find the reviews of anything here to make your purchase choices more curated and suitable to your needs. Read the opinions of products and places from other users to help you make a smart decision. Write reviews to provide feedback and help others in their purchases. Our smart system provides reviews based on their interests and keeps the user notified with new reviews from their favorite reviewer. 

Slogan - One stop solution to find the review of anything.

1.Who are your target users of the application?
Our target customers are especially the people of age 16-40 years. 

2.What problem/task does the application help the users address?
It is a platform which demystifies purchase choices by providing users with the opinions and experiences of other users. When a user wants to know the details of a product they want to buy, or a place they want to visit, they can get an idea by reading about the good and the bad from users who have used the product or visited the place. 
The app would also provide users with timely updates of new reviews based on their interests.

3.What three current apps on the Play Store (or other app stores, such as iTunes) 
would be your closest competitors?
The three apps we found our closest competitors are-
Yelp
Consumer report
Restaurant Guru

4.Why will your app be better or different than the competitors?
The other apps are limited to certain categories. Our app would provide a broader variety of options to check the reviews of. It also keeps the user updated with the reviews of any place the user visits based on their GPS location. 

5.What theme do you see when you browse the reviews of your competitors?
Common issues in the other apps are bugs in signing in. Users also complained about reviews not being up to date and the lack of an effective search mechanism.

6.What is innovative about your app idea? What will be particularly surprising and elegant about your app?
The main focus is to provide users with a broader variety of options to search for a review. It analyzes user preferences and curates a list of reviews which users usually check on the app. It also improves the search option by using KNN algorithm

7.What about your app will keep the user engaged?
It will notify users with new reviews added based on their interests which will urge the user to check the app. They would also get notifications when their favorite reviewer just posted something new and they would like to check it out. To get users to write reviews, the app would validate user profiles if they continuously provide reviews and make them top reviewers of certain categories by giving badges. This sense of validation would encourage more users to put in their reviews and help others with their decisions. 

8.What are the top potential weaknesses of your application idea and how will you address them?
A potential weakness of this app is that it is possible that no one would provide a review. In order to handle this, we would make it easier to provide reviews for a user. We will notify the user to update the review of any place which the user visits by checking their GPS location. Notifications can also be provided to users who read reviews to encourage them to provide their feedback if they went ahead with a certain purchase or not.

9.Will you be able to design, build and test the app before the end of the semester?
Yes, we will be able to complete the design, building and testing of the app before the end of semester.

10.Does it rely on a database that does not exist or cannot be accessed?
No, it doesn’t require any external database. We will be using our own database to store user reviews.

11. Does it rely on high quality content to be generated?
No, it doesn’t require any high quality content to be generated. It will be using a simple interactive UI that doesn’t require much loading.

12. Does it rely on magical capabilities?
No, it won’t rely on such capabilities. It uses simple search mechanism to fetch user reviews and shows reviews based on user interest using KNN algorithm.








P2 Project Design Assignment 

Login Screen (sign in & create account, Guest SignIn)
Home Screen->(Categories)  card design-> Review Screen(search bar & Recycler view which shows results(same as Feeds screen). On click of any review (Review Screen which contains review, reviewer name and picture)
Feeds(KNN algorithm) top reviews based of user interest.
Account (edit profile and logout)
Floating action button -> Item name, review (upto 300 characters) and upload image, submit button.

 
 
 
 
Screen 1 - Feed Design - Prototype 1
User clicks “Category” on the navigation bar to go to the Categories screen
User clicks on Floating Action button, launches new screen to let user add a review for a product of their choice

User can scroll through list of reviews 

Feedback on Prototype 1 of Feed Screen
Star ratings of the product should be on the top right corner of card rather than on the image
The products listed are random. Would be easier to identify if there is a “Category” tag present in the card
Use icons in the navigation bar rather than words
 
 
 
 
 
Screen 1 - Feed Design - Prototype 2
User clicks on a card in list to open the review of a product

User clicks on Floating Action button, launches new screen to let user add a review for a product of their choice

User can search for item of choice through search option on top

Feedback on Prototype 2 of Feed Screen
User could not figure out how to add a review. Suggested to make the floating action button more visible/accessible
Include the review description on the card in the list rather than seeing no review at all. Can then click on card to see the whole review
“Excellent”, “Average” adjectives are similar to the star ratings provided. Only one would be enough
User name should be included below the category tag
 
 
 
 
 
Screen 2 - Write a Review Design - Prototype 1
User can enter review title and provide ratings by clicking on the number of stars

User can provide category tag by clicking on the drop down
User clicks on Post to submit review they entered

Feedback on Prototype 1 of Write a Review Screen
User was not sure what to enter in the title box. Would be easier to know with a hint provided in the text box (like “Product Review Title”
Product and category drop down should be above the review text box. This is to make sure the user enters these parameters which are necessary for a review. Entering the veview description itself is optional
Adding photo should be more accessible
Navigation bar should be present
 
 
 
 
 
Screen 2 - Write a Review Design - Prototype 2
User can click on “upload photo” to include photos of product

User can enter category/tags of product they are reviewing

User can click on back button to exit from the Write a Review screen

Feedback on Prototype 2 of Write a Review Screen
“Post” instead of “Submit” sounds more accurate to add a review
Category should be a drop down. Entering the category name for a product is confusing
Provide hints in textbox to help user understand what to type
 
 
 
 
 
 
Final design of the 2 screens based on feedback
